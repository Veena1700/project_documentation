## Backend Overview
The backend of the Uber Clone Application is developed using Flask (Python), providing a modular and scalable REST API architecture to support essential features such as user and captain authentication, real-time ride management, payment processing, and user feedback collection. Here's a breakdown of its core components:

### Framework & Tools
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework used to build RESTful API endpoints.
- **Flask-JWT-Extended**: Handles secure authentication using JWT tokens.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions with MySQL.
- **Flask-SocketIO**: Enables real-time communication between users and captains (for ride events).
- **Marshmallow**: Used for data serialization and validation.

### Authentication & Authorization
This section outlines how users and captains register/login, how JWT tokens are handled, and how token expiration is managed.

#### 1. Registration & Login Flow
**User/Captain Registration**
- Users register with firstname, lastname, email, and password (hashed).
- Captains also provide vehicle details: color, plate, capacity, and type.
- After successful registration, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client.

**User/Captain Login**
- Verifies email and password (hashed) against stored records.
- If valid, issues a JWT token and returns it along with profile info.
- Updates last_login timestamp in the respective activity table (UserActivity or CaptainActivity).

#### 2. JWT Token Handling
**Token Generation**
- JWT is generated using:
  ```python
  create_access_token(identity=user_id)
  ```
- Includes the user/captain ID as the token's identity.

**Token Validation**
- The custom decorator `@auth_user`:
  - Ensures token is present and valid using `verify_jwt_in_request()`.
  - Checks the token is not blacklisted.
  - Confirms user/captain still exists in the DB.

**Client Storage**
- Tokens are sent in JSON responses.
- On the client side, they should be securely stored in `localStorage`.

#### 3. Token Expiry
- Configured as:
  ```python
  app.config['JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES'] = timedelta(days=7)
  ```
- Access tokens expire after 7 days for added security.

### What is Socket.IO?
Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients (e.g., browser/mobile apps) and the server using WebSockets under the hood. Unlike HTTP, which is request-response-based, WebSockets allow persistent connections for instant event-based updates.

### Why Use Sockets in Ride Booking App?
- Instantly notify users and captains when a ride is booked, accepted, or started.
- Improve responsiveness and interactivity.

### Socket Connection Lifecycle
**1. connect**
- Triggered when a client connects.
- Logs the unique `socket.id` of the connected client.
- Used to track each user's active session.
```python
@socketio.on('connect')
def handle_connect():
    print(f"Client connected: {request.sid}")
```

**2. join**
- Triggered when a user or captain logs in.
- Saves the client’s `socket.id` in the DB.
- Differentiates between user and captain.
- Enables targeted communication later.
```python
@socketio.on('join')
def handle_join(data):
    # data = {"userId": ..., "userType": "user" or "captain"}
```

**Use case**: Allows server to later send a ride request or confirmation directly to that user/captain.

**3. disconnect**
- Triggered when a client disconnects (closes app/browser).
- Logs that the user is disconnected.
- Can be extended to update captain's online/offline status.
```python
@socketio.on('disconnect')
def handle_disconnect():
    print(f"Client disconnected: {request.sid}")
```

### Server-Emitted Socket Events (Real-time Messages)
**4. send_message_to_socket_id**
- Utility to send message to a specific user/captain.
```python
def send_message_to_socket_id(socket_id, event, data):
    socketio.emit(event, data, room=socket_id)
```
Used when you want to send a targeted update (e.g., ride confirmation to a specific captain).

### App-Specific Real-Time Events
**1. new-ride**
- Broadcast when a user books a ride.
- Sent to all captains (or filtered subset).
- Contains user info, pickup, destination, fare, etc.
```python
socketio.emit("new-ride", ride_data, to=None)
```
Allows captains to see available ride requests in real time.

**2. ride-confirmed**
- Sent after a captain accepts a ride.
- Delivered to the user who created the ride.
- Contains captain info, fare, duration, etc.
```python
socketio.emit("ride-confirmed", ride_data, to=None)
```
Notifies the user that their ride has been accepted and who their captain is.

**3. ride-started**
- Sent when captain starts the ride (OTP verified).
- Confirms ride has begun.
- Contains all essential ride info: captain, destination, fare, duration, etc.
```python
socketio.emit("ride-started", ride_data, to=None)
```
Keeps the user informed and can trigger a UI change to ride-in-progress mode.

### Summary Flow (Socket Events in Action)
1. User opens app → connect → join  
2. Captain opens app → connect → join  
3. User books ride → new-ride emitted  
4. Captain sees ride → confirms → ride-confirmed to user  
5. Captain verifies OTP → starts ride → ride-started emitted  
6. Any client disconnects → disconnect

## API Routes
This part outlines the available API endpoints for the Uber clone app. Routes are grouped by functionality—User, Captain, Ride, Map, Payment, and Ratings—each responsible for specific features like authentication, ride booking, payments, and feedback.

### User Routes
**POST /user/register**:  
Creates a new user with email and hashed password after checking for duplicates.  
Saves the user in the database and returns success or error message.

**POST /user/login**:  
Validates email and password against stored credentials.  
If valid, returns a JWT token for session authentication.

**GET /user/profile**:  
Decodes the JWT token sent in the request headers.  
Fetches and returns user details like name and email.

**POST /user/logout**:  
Invalidates the JWT token by adding it to a denylist.  
Ensures the token can't be reused for further requests.

### Captain Routes
**POST /captain/register**:
